Hi, there! I am a virtual character created by example based approach. To sythesize a realistic facial 
animation, a number of visual example models are used in this approach. As you are seen in this demo, 
14 different phoneme models are used and linked with a TTS system to generate the real time lipsyncing 
animation. In near future, facial expressions as well as more detailed expressions will be added to create 
a more realistic animation. Thank you.
